The Saga* of Lashstab
=====================

\* actual saga coming soon




### The Second Year

We struck the earth! The dwarves of Lashstab entered a cave beneath the fortress. The cave was not immediately aggressive, but risk must wait until the proper defenses have been prepared. The cave was immediately sealed.

A craftsdwarf fell to madness, claiming a workshop as her own and striking any who came near. She was killed, in self defense, and is currently undergoing burialization.

Patrons welcomed the opening of a butcher shop; meat is officially on the menu.

The twilight hammer cult has moved to farming. They now have their own guild hall where they regularly demonstrate gelding for all to watch.

A growing order of necromancers concerns Fath. They have not reanimated anything yet, but it's only a matter of time.

## The Third Year

### First Entry

Here follow the accounts of Minterwute, rector and leader of the fort as of the 252-01-01.

As I begin my tenure, I must take stock of the situation that my predecessors have left me with.
Each of them has had their own distinctive style, their own personal priorities, their own novel motivations.

What they had in common however appears to be their complete disregard for fortress security.
I'm absolutely appalled by the state of fortress defenses and precautions that have been put into place to ensure the safety of its inhabitants.
Which is to say: None. There are no fortifications, no redundancies, no military presence, no airlocks.

Honestly, there aren't even enough doors to go around.

Not wishing to speak ill of my forebears, I must undertake the important task of planning and constructing adequate security measures.
I hope to all put in place a framework so that my eventual successors might be able to continue and extend these measures as we delve deeper into the earth.

Even as the first day begins, I already know the first order of business:
A vastly deep stairwell currently plunges deep into the ground, piercing into a layer of underground caverns.
These deep running stairs are not isolated in any way; positioned in the very middle of the fortress, they're not even blocked up by doors.

Moving the entire stairwell is too great of an undertaking. Instead, we will terminate the shaft before it enters the caverns.
Here, we will also add a double airlock, from which we may safely continue the passage downwards.
Should any threat to the fortress emerge, the lower levels of the fortress may be sealed away, protecting its residents from the giant spiders that allegedly reside below.

The second project that we will undertake is the designation of safe areas to which the population may retreat in the case of overwhelming danger.
An ideal location for this would be the dormitory level, just below the above-ground constructions of the fort.
In an emergency, the population will retreat into this level and seal themselves in, hopefully with a reasonable stock of provisions.

The last order of business is to figure out a situation with burials. We've got a corpse lying up top, and its kind of starting to smell.
